## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-06

First public release.

### Added
- **Collections** — follow albums, mark stickers as owned, track quantities.
- **Duplicates** — copies beyond the first are swappable doubles.
- **Statistics** — completion progress and a packs-needed estimate
  (coupon-collector formula).
- **Swaps** — trade proposals (give / receive) with a
  `pending → accepted → completed` flow.
- **Public share page** — tokenized, cacheable page listing a collector's
  missing stickers and duplicates (`/u/{token}`), no login required.
- **Accounts & roles** — moderated sign-up, admin user management, optional
  Google SSO.
- **Checklist UX** — Turbo Streams (left-click +1 / right-click −1) with an
  animated counter; client-side search & filters.
- **Album import** — JSON (full album) or CSV (stickers), web (`/albums/import`)
  and CLI (`app:album:import`).
- **Pixel / retro UI** theme with DiceBear pixel-art avatars.

### Packaging & operations
- Runs on the `smalswebtech/base-php` image (PHP 8.5, nginx + php-fpm,
  read-only root filesystem).
- FastCGI micro-cache, rate limiting and security headers wired in the vhost.
- Prometheus metrics and OpenTelemetry tracing (auto-instrumented).
- Multi-arch image (linux/amd64 + linux/arm64), **cosign**-signed and
  **Trivy**-scanned.

### CI/CD
- GitHub Actions: lint + PHPUnit, `docker buildx bake` (native per-arch build →
  push by digest → manifest merge), cosign signing, Trivy scan, automated
  GitHub Release, scheduled run cleanup, grouped Dependabot updates.
